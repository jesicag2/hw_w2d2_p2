# HW2_P1: Nested Decisions: The Adventure Game üè∞

# Task 1: Code Correction

place = input("Choose a place: forest or cave? ")

if place == "forest":
    action = input("climb a tree or cross a river? ")

        print("You found a boat!")

# Task 2: Setting the Scene
'''
Based on the corrected code from Task 1, expand the game. If the user 
chooses "cave", ask them if they want to "light a torch" or "proceed in the dark", 
and provide outcomes for each decision.

# Task 3: Default Path

If the user makes an invalid choice at any point, use the pass statement for now. 
Later, you can enhance this to provide feedback or a different branch of the story.
